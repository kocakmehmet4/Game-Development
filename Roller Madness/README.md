The point of the roller madness game was basically for me to learn how to use unity's arguments, and see myself doing something.

How is the game played?
In the game, after a certain number of seconds by escaping from the enemies or by collecting coins, you can pass to the next level,
but if the enemy hits you, you will fail in the game.or if you hit the objects on the ground , your score will be reduced by 10. 
The game consists of 2 levels.
